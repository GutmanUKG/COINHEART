                        "Service"). The Service allows accredited and other users ("Users") to participate in token
                        offerings by blockchain companies ("Token Developers"), to buy or sell cryptocurrencies, or
                        to lend or borrow cryptocurrencies. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") is designed to explain
                        how we collect, use, and share information from users of the Service, including Users and
                        Token Developers. This Policy is incorporated by reference into our
                        <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>. By agreeing to this Policy in your
                        account setup and through your continued use of the Service, you agree to the terms and
                        conditions of this Policy.

                        <u>Registration</u>:
                        If you register with us or one of our customers as a User, you are required to provide us
                        with your name and email address and to designate a password. In order to participate in
                        certain token offerings or use our cryptocurrency trading venue as a User, we may also
                        require certain information to confirm your status as an accredited investor. For example,
                        Users hoping to participate in a token offering or trade cryptocurrency in an individual
                        capacity, and not on behalf of a corporation or trust, must provide their full name, social
                        security number, phone number, address, date of birth, and if such participation requires
                        the User to be an accredited investor, proof of required assets (such as an asset appraisal)
                        or income (such as tax filings or pay stubs), as well. More information regarding investor
                        accreditation is available <a href="help.html">here</a>. We may also require Users
                        to complete a short questionnaire regarding their interest in specific types of tokens and
                        cryptocurrencies.

                    <p>
                        Token Developers will provide us with information about their project and token offering,
                        certain of which will be provided to potential Users to assist in making a decision about

                        cryptocurrencies using traditional fiat currency and/or cryptocurrency. To facilitate these
                        transactions, we may collect necessary financial information, such as your bank's routing
                        number and your account number.

                        of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to
