                                                building and shipping product. You’ll write clean, well-documented code,
                                                do unit tests, follow best practices, and have the benefit of working in

                                            <li>You love security. You read about this stuff on nights and weekends. You

                                                teaching others and constantly learning. You read and question things.

                                            <li>You like to ship. You focus on the things that matter and push back on
                                                things that don’t. People know they can count on you to get things done.
